<h1 align="center">⏱️ Study Timer ⏱️</h1>

A small timer I quickly built for myself to help me study.

This timer will randomly alert you a set amount of times in a set amount of time, to take 10 seconds breaks of closing the eyes and practising mindfulness.
This greatly improves the brains learning as told by Andrew Hueberman.

## ONLY SETUP FOR LINUX

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/jayfalls/study_timer
cd study_timer
./start.sh
